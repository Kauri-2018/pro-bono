  details: [
    'Janice lives alone with very limited English, and had only gone to school for a couple of years in her home country before coming to New Zealand. She was scammed by a woman who deceived Janice into signing a 24-month mobile phone contract which included the latest smartphone. The woman took the phone and Janice never saw her again. Janice was left owing over $2,500 to the mobile phone company. She approached the Law Centre for help. The Centre helped her prepare evidence to file a police complaint, and entered into discussions with the phone company and the debt collector. It was settled that Janice would only pay $100 of the debt and the rest would be cancelled.',

    `G & L are in their late 405 with several grandchildren. They have always been a low
    income family. In June 2008, they entered into what they believed was a rent to buy
    for their first house, using their life savings of $1,000 as a deposit. The ongoing cost
    was $400 per week, plus all repairs and maintenance. They knew market rent was
    around $260 per week. While the promotional material talked about rent to buy, the
    agreement was just an option to purchase. Eighty dollars of the $400 was to be put
    towards a ’deposit’. Under the contract, in the event of a default all monies were the
    landlord's and the option to purchase no longer existed.`,

    `Late 2011, the landlord (who has 20 or so other properties), went to the Tenancy
    Tribunal to evict G & L as they were in arrears. The landlord sought compensation for
    damages to the property, plus cleaning. He claimed that the whole house needed
    repainting from top to bottom, as well as new curtains, carpets and landscaping.`,

    `The client signed a tenancy agreement on behalf of a "friend," who was unwilling and
    unable to enter into a tenancy agreement due to her precarious finances. She assured
    the client that she would pay the rent. It turned out this friend had induced the client
    to enter many transactions to his financial detriment. She defaulted on rent running
    up thousands of dollars of debt.`,

    `A tenancy agreement is a common transaction which would ordinarily be enforceable.
    However, as the client presented, it was readily apparent that he had an intellectual
    disability. His support worker advised he was unable to read or write and had very
    limited comprehension; this left him open to people who took advantage of his good
    nature.`,

    `The Centre drafted submissions to empower the client with the assistance of his
    support worker; putting forward the argument that he lacked capacity to enter into
    the agreement. The Tenancy Tribunal agreed and found for him.`,

    `The landlord appealed to the District Court. Again, the Law Centre drafted submissions
    and gathered evidence. The Judge found for the client and dismissed the appeal. The
    client would have been unable to advance the complex arguments around intellectual
    incapacity to contract and navigate the tribunals and courts without assistance.`,

    `A client had been a helicopter pilot in New Guinea and then got tropical malaria which
    caused him to have a stroke. He has been unable to work since and on a sickness
    benefit. His company had insured him and others under a ’block' lump sum
    compensation policy for disability. The policy was with Lloyds of London who used
    every trick in the book' not to pay.
    
    Eventually the Law Centre had the UK Insurance and Financial Ombudsman review the
matter and he ’requested' them to pay (apparently he could not order it - only a Court
could do that) and they did pay.`,

    `The client’s 36 year old son passed away after falling from a box. In the incident
    (accident), he scratched his leg, but it was imagined that this was a minor injury that
    would resolve itself. Less than 48 hours later he was dead. He had contracted a
    secondary infection, necrotising faciitis, which took his life very swiftly and left his
    family shocked and bewildered.`,

    `The day after the fall his leg ached severely and his mother took him to their doctor,
    who queried whether the abrasion had caused sepsis. However, the ACC claim form
    has room for three diagnoses, so he listed other concerns such as possible tendon
    damage. The doctor failed to note the ”abrasion", although his notes clearly recorded
    this. Antibiotics and pain medication were prescribed.`,

    `ACC’s stance was that, as the Coroner referred to his death as due to ‘natural causes’,
    although he had cover for his injury itself, the injury had not resulted in his death. The
    evidence showed this was plainly wrong. After submitting further evidence from his
    GP and pointing out the obvious connection between the injury and his death, ACC
    accepted cover in June 2011 (after a delay in part caused by the Christchurch
    earthquakes).`,

    `When it arrived, minutes later, he could not lift his arms either, and was
    incoherent and semi-conscious. He died at 11pm that same day from multiple organ
    failure. On admission, the scratch on his leg was a large ulceration the hospital believed
    was a serious burn from a hot water bottle. It covered most of his lower calf area.
    The client, Mum, came to see the Law Centre in January 2011, she had been trying to
    get ACC to pay a grant towards her son's funeral since August 2010. She was bereft,
    depressed and undergoing counselling. As an invalid’s beneficiary, she had paid what
    she could towards his funeral, but she was struggling to meet the rest ofthis debt, over
    $5,000.`,

    `She had found a job as a waitress on minimum wage ($13.50). She had a written
    employment agreement and was to work a minimum of 35 hours per week. The
    employment agreement had a trial period but it was a performance based trial (567)
    not the 90-day trial period (567a).`,

    `Besides the odd job here and there this was her first full time job. She worked for 6
    weeks (31 August - 17 September 2011) when at the end of her shift all the waitresses
    were called together by the Manager and told one of them was being fired that night.
    The client was then dismissed.`,

    `She was so distraught she had to be picked up by her mother. The Manager spoke to
    the mother and apologised for having to dismiss her and said that if he did not the
    owner was going to dismiss him. He also said that the owner had instructed him to
    dismiss her because she served the owner the wrong drink the previous evening.
    Effectively there was no process; she was not made aware that her employment was
    at risk, no allegations were raised before dismissal; and she had no opportunity to say
    anything in her defence.`,

    `She was upset with the dismissal and contacted the owner for the reason she was
    dismissed. The owner responded by letter saying that she had been dismissed because
    she was on the 90-day trial period (no process is required by the employer - 567A).`,

    `A personal grievance was raised without response from the employer. A request for
    mediation was made due to no response from the employer for 2 weeks. The
    Department of Labour (DOL) contacted the employer and he agreed to mediation but
    would not agree a date. Eventually the employer stopped responding to DOL and
    mediation did not go ahead.`,

    `An application (Statement of Problem) was filed with the Employment Relations
    Authority (ERA). The employer did not respond nor attend the teleconference. An
    investigation meeting date was set.`,

    `To ensure that the employer had no excuse not to attend the investigation meeting,
    the Law Centre also served the employer with the Statement of Problem, Bundle of
    Evidence and Notice of Hearing at the last known address for service on the Companies
    Office records. An affidavit to this effect was also filed with the ERA.`,

    `The employer failed to attend the investigation meeting. The Authority Member
    attempted to contact the employer at the last known phone number without success.
    The Authority Member was satisfied that all papers had been served on the employer
    and the investigation meeting went ahead without the employer having reasonable
    excuse for not attending.`,

    `Our client was successful and awarded $6,142.50 (gross) lost wages and $4,000 hurt
    and humiliation. Subsequently the employer’s business was put into liquidation and
    the Centre assisted the client in lodging a claim with the liquidators.`,

    `The client’s income reduced significantly when she quit herjob to care for her daughter
    full time. The additional money from the DPB-CSI, although not much more than the
    DPB-SP (just over $40 per week), went on living costs and her daughter’s special needs.
    Sometimes there was not enough money for petrol to attend the Law Centre. The
    application process took up to 6 months and was likely to have increased stress levels
    and hardship in the family home.`,

    `The client’s daughter suffers from severe Separation Anxiety and Obsessive
    Compulsive Disorder (’OCD’). She has also recently been diagnosed with General
    Anxiety Disorder. The client’s ca re for her daughter is 24/7 and she has struggled with
    these diagnoses and high needs relating to associated behaviours since she was six
    years old (2006). Although the client worked on and off during those years she
    frequently took her daughter to work or had to quit work in order to attend to her
    needs.`
